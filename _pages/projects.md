### PL (+/-) HCI
__Unfamiliar Abstractions__ [[EPIC Advance poster](../files/epic-poster-sp23.pdf)] \
Can we use program synthesis to produce *program translations* that enable users to understand code written in unfamiliar languages? Collaboration with [Justin Lubin](https://jlubin.net), Kevin Ye, Laila Walker, and [Prof. Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com).

__NumPy Program Synthesis__ <a name="numpy"></a> [[PLDI 2024 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3656453)] [[github](https://github.com/justinlubin/cobbler)] \
A program synthesizer that generates NumPy from Python for loops, intended to allow a broader audience of programmers to write higher-performance code. Project in collaboration with [Justin Lubin](https://jlubin.net), Jeremy Ferguson, Kevin Ye, and [Prof. Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com).

__SEPO__ [[poster](../files/sepo-poster.pdf)] [[paper](../files/sepo-paper.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/skberkeley/sepo)] \
A symbolic execution engine for RISC-V assembly, used to output traces of CPU states and discover optimizing rewrites. Class project for CS 264 at Berkeley, in collaboration with [Sora Kanosue](https://skanosue.com).

### CS/Design Education

__Flexible Extensions__ [[github](https://github.com/cs161-staff/extensions)] [[more info](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/projects/flextensions/)] \
An automated system for requesting and granting extensions on programming assignments, aiming to reduce workloads for course staff in large computer science courses and improve student quality of life.

__Teaming by Design__ [[github](https://github.com/teamingbydesign/txd-pipeline)] [[website](https://www.teamingxdesign.com/)] \
How can we improve experiences for students in design courses with team-based projects? We designed a data pipeline for processing surveys of team members and created visualizations for giving students actionable, data-driven feedback.
