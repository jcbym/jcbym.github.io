Hi! I am a 5th year MS student studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by [Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com/).

My research focus is at the intersection of **programming languages** and **human-computer interaction**. My current work aims to improve the usability of program synthesizers through new user interfaces explaining synthesis outputs. I am also interested in applications of PL + HCI techniques to data science and computer science education!

I am part of the [PLAIT Lab](https://plait-lab.org/) at [UC Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I have also been involved with the [ACE Lab](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/) and [Teaming by Design](https://www.teamingxdesign.com/) at Berkeley, researching assignment extensions in computer science courses and building software for data-driven student feedback in team-based design courses, respectively.

## Current Projects
__Synthesis Interfaces__ [[EPIC Advance poster](../files/epic-poster-sp23.pdf)] \
How can we design new interfaces for program synthesis that enable users to understand generated programs in unfamiliar languages? This builds off of the [NumPy Program Synthesis](#numpy) project, in collaboration with Kevin Ye, [Justin Lubin](https://jlubin.net), and [Prof. Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com).

__Flexible Extensions__ [[github](https://github.com/cs161-staff/extensions)] [[more info](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/projects/flextensions/)] \
A system for requesting and granting extensions on programming assignments, aiming to reduce workloads for course staff in large computer science courses and improve student quality of life.

__Teaming by Design__ [[github](https://github.com/teamingbydesign/txd-pipeline)] [[website](https://www.teamingxdesign.com/)] \
How can we improve experiences for students in courses with team-based projects? We designed a data pipeline for processing surveys of team members and created visualizations for giving students actionable, data-driven feedback.

## Past Projects
__SEPO__ [[final project poster](../files/sepo-poster.pdf)] [[final project report](../files/sepo-paper.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/skberkeley/sepo)] \
A symbolic execution engine for RISC-V assembly, used to output traces of CPU states and discover optimizing rewrites. Class project for CS 264 at Berkeley, in collaboration with [Sora Kanosue](https://skanosue.com).

__NumPy Program Synthesis__ <a name="numpy"></a> \
A program synthesizer that generates NumPy from Python for loops, intended to allow a broader audience of programmers to write higher-performance code. Project in collaboration with [Justin Lubin](https://jlubin.net), Jeremy Ferguson, Kevin Ye, and [Prof. Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com).

## Other
I teach science lessons at elementary and middle schools with [Berkeley Engineers and Mentors](https://beam.berkeley.edu). As part of the Curriculum committee, I write lessons for our students.

For fun, I also run [Smash at Berkeley](https://smash.berkeley.edu), a club organizing tournaments for the Super Smash Bros. series of games.
