Hi! I am a 5th year MS student studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by [Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com/). My research focus is at the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction, but I am also interested in data science and computer science education. My current work focuses on improving the usability of program synthesizers. I am part of the [PLAIT Lab](https://plait-lab.org/) at [UC Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).
