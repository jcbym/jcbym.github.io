Hi! I am a 5th year MS student studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by [Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com/).

My research focus is at the intersection of **programming languages** and **human-computer interaction**. My current work focuses on improving the usability of program synthesizers. I am also interested in applications of PL + HCI to data science and computer science education!

I am part of the [PLAIT Lab](https://plait-lab.org/) at [UC Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I have also been involved with the [ACE Lab](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/) and [Teaming by Design](https://www.teamingxdesign.com/) at Berkeley, researching assignment extensions in computer science courses and building software for data-driven feedback in team-based design courses, respectively.
