Hi! I am a 5th year MS student studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by (Sarah E. Chasins)[https://schasins.com/]. My research focus lies at the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction, but I am also interested in data science and computer science education. My current work focuses on improving the usability of program synthesizers. I am part of the (PLAIT Lab)[https://plait-lab.org/] at (UC Berkeley EECS)[https://eecs.berkeley.edu/].
