Hi! I am a 5th year MS student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by [Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com/). This fall, I will be starting a PhD at UC San Diego in the [ProgSys Group](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/)!

My primary research focus is at the intersection of **programming languages** and **human-computer interaction**. My current work explores interfaces for improving code comprehension using program synthesis. I am excited by research that makes programming easier for novice and nontraditional programmers.

I am part of the [PLAIT Lab](https://plait-lab.org/) at [UC Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I have also been involved with the [ACE Lab](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/) and [Teaming by Design](https://www.teamingxdesign.com/) at Berkeley, researching assignment extensions in computer science courses and building software for data-driven student feedback in team-based design courses, respectively.

## Other
I teach science lessons at elementary and middle schools with [Berkeley Engineers and Mentors](https://beam.berkeley.edu). As part of the Curriculum committee, I write lessons for our students.

For fun, I also run [Smash at Berkeley](https://smash.berkeley.edu), a club organizing tournaments for the Super Smash Bros. series of games.
