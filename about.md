Hi! I am a 1st year PhD student in Computer Science at UC San Diego, advised by [Michael Coblenz](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mcoblenz/). Previously, I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by [Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com/) and mentored by [Justin Lubin](https://jlubin.net/).  I owe a lot to these amazing mentors, both past and present!

My primary research focus is at the intersection of **human-computer interaction** and **programming languages**. <ins>I want to build new programming systems that make it easier for users from nontechnical backgrounds to write and understand code.</ins> Currently, I'm excited about helping data scientists work more interactively with their data using direct manipulation and live programming.
