### Programming Tools
__Jupyter Notebook Corpus Study__ [[paper](../assets/files/notebooks.pdf)] \
In order to better understand how to support Jupyter Notebook users, we conducted an exploratory corpus study of 30 real-world notebooks. We classified notebooks based on application, structure, and types of data transformations. We found that notebooks are used in diverse ways, identifying opportunities to support notebook users through nonlinear structure. Class project for CSE 291-B00 at UCSD, with [Qinshi Zhang](https://carolzhangzz.github.io/).

__Unfamiliar Abstractions__ [[EPIC Advance poster](../assets/files/epic-poster-sp23.pdf)] \
Can we use program synthesis to produce *program translations* that enable users to understand code written in unfamiliar languages? Collaboration with [Justin Lubin](https://jlubin.net), Kevin Ye, Laila Walker, and [Prof. Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com).

__NumPy Program Synthesis__ <a name="numpy"></a> [[PLDI 2024 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3656453)] [[github](https://github.com/justinlubin/cobbler)] \
A program synthesizer that generates NumPy from Python for loops, intended to allow a broader audience of programmers to write higher-performance code. Collaboration with [Justin Lubin](https://jlubin.net), Jeremy Ferguson, Kevin Ye, and [Prof. Sarah E. Chasins](https://schasins.com).

__SEPO__ [[poster](../assets/files/sepo-poster.pdf)] [[paper](../assets/files/sepo-paper.pdf)] [[github](https://github.com/skberkeley/sepo)] \
A symbolic execution engine for RISC-V assembly, used to output traces of CPU states and discover optimizing rewrites. Class project for CS 264 at Berkeley, with [Sora Kanosue](https://skanosue.com).

### CS/Design Education

__Flexible Extensions__ [[github](https://github.com/cs161-staff/extensions)] [[more info](https://acelab.berkeley.edu/projects/flextensions/)] \
An automated system for requesting and granting extensions on programming assignments, aiming to reduce workloads for course staff in large computer science courses and improve student quality of life.

__Teaming by Design__ [[github](https://github.com/teamingbydesign/txd-pipeline)] [[website](https://www.teamingxdesign.com/)] \
How can we improve experiences for students in design courses with team-based projects? We designed a data pipeline for processing surveys of team members and created visualizations for giving students actionable, data-driven feedback.
